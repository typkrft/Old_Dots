## Tips and Recommendations
- the theme has italics support, but you need a font that also has an italics variation. I recommend Jetbrains Mono (Free), Operator Mono (Paid, 200$) but most themes support those as well.
- I am thinking of making a Icon theme that matches spaceduck, but for now I have found that **material-theme-icons-palenight** works best.
- here is a set of font related settings I would recommend
```json
{
    "editor.fontSize": 17,
    "editor.lineHeight": 25,
    "editor.letterSpacing": 0.5,
    "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
}
```
